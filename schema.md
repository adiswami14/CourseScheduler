# Schema

### Course

This will keep track of general course information, such as the name of the course, the teacher, and the time at which this is taught. 
The output() method will be the way how I will keep track via the console.

### Schedule

This is solely responsible for the timing. It binds a time to a specific cell in the data table, upon which we can bind a course to that cell. This will end up creating a coherent schedule, which we can **display to the world**.

### Main.js

Basically will hold everything together.
